# structure-lab

*A modeling experiment in 5 parts — from replication to randomness.*

This repository is a curated collection of modeling experiments that explore how **mathematical structures** can be used to tame financial uncertainty. From replicating payoff paths to encoding jumps, each folder documents a structural idea — not just a formula.

I started this project during my independent research into financial mathematics and stochastic modeling. What began as curiosity turned into a deep interest in how assumptions about time, uncertainty, and decision shape the models we build.

## Project Structure

| Module | Title | Key Question |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| 01 | **Black-Scholes** | How can we replicate uncertainty with a continuous structure? |
| 02 | **Binomial Tree & Chooser** | Can we embed optimal choice into a discrete system? |
| 03 | **Backtesting Logic** | What does it take to simulate a decision process, not just a strategy? |
| 04 | **Risk-Neutral World** | Why do we change probability not to predict, but to construct? |
| 05 | **Jump-Diffusion** | What happens when the world is no longer continuous? |

Each module includes:
- Python implementation
- Structural commentary
- Visual diagrams (when applicable)
- Reflection or mini-essay

All essays originally published in my English blog are included in `/06-essays`. These serve as narrative explanations of the ideas behind each model.

> **This project is not about running models. It’s about questioning assumptions — and seeing what kind of world we build from them.**
